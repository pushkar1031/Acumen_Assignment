# Acumen_Assignment

My Approach: 
First i have gone through all problem statement that was mentioned in Assignment , then i have used html and css to designed UI.
After that i have written logic by using javascript.
i used fetch function to make asynchronous requests to the server and load the information that is returned by the server onto the web pages.

Kindly find the attached source code in index.html and images of picture gallery application in the repository.
